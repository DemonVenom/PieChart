# PieChart

⦁	Pie chart: prompt the user (at the command line) for 4 positive integers, then draw a pie chart in a window. Convert the numbers to percentages of the numbers’ total sum; color each segment differently; use Arc2D. No text fields (other than the window title) are required. Provide a driver in a separate source file to test your class.
